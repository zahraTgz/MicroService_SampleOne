# Microservices Project

This project is a simple microservices-based application designed to demonstrate the implementation of microservices with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

## Overview

The application provides a set of RESTful APIs to manage core operations for a given service, ensuring seamless communication between microservices. Each service operates independently with its own logic and database schema, leveraging the power of Spring Boot for rapid development.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**: The primary framework for building microservices.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database used for storing application data.
- **Zipkin**: A distributed tracing system that helps to monitor and troubleshoot latency issues by tracking requests across microservices.
- **pgAdmin**: A management tool for PostgreSQL that provides an interface for database administration, query execution, and monitoring.



## Features

- Independent microservices for managing different parts of the application.
- RESTful APIs for accessing and manipulating data.
- Database management with PostgreSQL.
- Distributed tracing with Zipkin to troubleshoot and optimize microservice communication.
- PostgreSQL database management and monitoring with pgAdmin.


## Requirements

- **Java 17** or higher
- **PostgreSQL** installed and configured
- **Maven** 
- **RabbitMQ**
- **Zipkin** and **pgAdmin** installed and configured by Docker compose file
